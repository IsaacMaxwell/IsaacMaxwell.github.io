title: Project Definition - Materiality, Towards Autonomous Objects.
---
This project will create an installation piece that explores the materiality of ceramic objects, providing a platform that allows questions of matter, form and autonomy to be explored. I will be using established techniques within music computing as the technical framework for this work, in particular, contact microphones, dc motors and 
Max Msp will be the tool for investigating chosen materials.  
The objective of this project is to allow mundane objects to be freed from the prescribed purpose that form imposes upon them, and in result allow materials to sound freely.
